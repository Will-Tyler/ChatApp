#  ChatApp

An iOS messaging app written with Swift 4.2 and using a Firebase backend.

## Motivation

I worked on this app mostly over 2018 Winter Break in order to work on my Swift and iOS Development skills. I also wanted to become familiar with using Google Firebase, which is a very quick and simple way to kickstart different projects.
